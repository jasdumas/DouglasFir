**Angiosperm (an·gi·o·sperm)**  - a plant that has flowers and produces seeds enclosed within a carpel. The angiosperms are a large group and include herbaceous plants, shrubs, grasses, and most trees.   

**Annotation** - is the process by which pertinent information about these raw DNA sequences is added to the genome databases. This involves describing different regions of the code and identifying which regions can be called genes.

# E
**exon** - refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA.
# F
**FASTA format** - A sequence record in a FASTA format consists of a single-line description (sequence name), followed by line(s) of sequence data. The first character of the description line is a greater-than (">") symbol.
# G
**general feature format** - (gene-finding format, generic feature format, GFF) is a file format used for describing genes and other features of DNA, RNA and protein sequences. The filename extension associated with such files is .GFF
# H
# I
**intron** - refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. Sequences that are joined together in the final mature RNA after RNA splicing are exons.

**[PLAZA](http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/versions/plaza_v3_dicots/download/index)** - is an access point for plant comparative genomics centralizing genomic data produced by different genome sequencing initiatives. It integrates plant sequence data and comparative genomics methods and provides an online platform to perform evolutionary analyses and data mining within the green plant lineage (Viridiplantae).

**[SOAPdenovo](http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html)** - is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a de novo draft assembly for the human-sized genomes. The program is specially designed to assemble Illumina GA short reads. It creates new opportunities for building reference sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost effective way.
